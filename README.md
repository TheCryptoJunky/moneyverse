# Moneyverse: Trading Bot using Reinforcement Learning and MEV Strategies

## Project Overview

Moneyverse is an advanced trading bot framework designed to double net asset value (NAV) hourly. This framework employs reinforcement learning (RL), multiple Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) strategies, and automated wallet swarms to capitalize on high-frequency trading opportunities. This project is intended for users who need robust, autonomous trading solutions in the crypto and financial markets.

## Key Features

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Adaptive RL agents trained for continuous performance improvement.
- **MEV Strategies**: Includes arbitrage, front-running, and other complex trading techniques.
- **Wallet Swarm Management**: Control and monitor multiple wallets simultaneously for optimal strategy execution.
- **Real-time Monitoring and Dynamic Adjustments**: Includes position sizer, risk manager, and performance tracker modules.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Gym
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Flask (for GUI management)
- Additional dependencies in `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheCryptoJunky/moneyverse.git
   cd moneyverse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the GUI**:
   The Flask GUI can be accessed locally via `http://127.0.0.1:5000` after starting the `flask_gui` module for real-time monitoring and configuration.

## Directory Structure

- **`algorithms/`**: Contains custom trading algorithms for various MEV strategies.
- **`all_logging/`**: Centralized logging for debugging and performance tracking.
- **`api/`**: API integrations for connecting to exchanges and data sources.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for defining bot parameters and settings.
- **`database/`**: Database handlers and models for trade and wallet data storage.
- **`flask_gui/`**: Flask-based GUI for monitoring and managing bot activities.
- **`helper_bots/`**: Auxiliary bots supporting main trading functions.
- **`kubernetes/`**: Kubernetes configuration files for deploying the bot cluster.
- **`managers/`**: Contains various managers (e.g., `wallet_manager`, `goal_manager`) for high-level bot operations.
- **`memory/`**: Short-term storage for quick data retrieval and analysis.
- **`monitoring/`**: Real-time monitoring and alerting for bot performance.
- **`position_sizer/`**: Calculates optimal trade sizes based on strategy and risk.
- **`reports/`**: Generates reports on bot performance and trading results.
- **`rl_agent/`**: Reinforcement learning agents that adapt to market conditions.
- **`safety/`**: Risk management and safety protocols for secure trading.
- **`strategies/`**: Core MEV strategies used by the bot framework.
- **`trade_executor/`**: Executes trades based on strategy signals and market data.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers (e.g., `error_handler`, `nav_calculator`).
- **`wallet/`**: Manages individual and swarm wallets for autonomous operations.

## Running Tests

Run unit tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Future Work

- **Advanced Reinforcement Learning Models**: Continual improvements to the self-learning capabilities.
- **Enhanced Flask GUI**: More real-time analytics and user-friendly features.
- **Additional MEV Strategies**: Constantly adding new MEV strategies for broader market coverage.
